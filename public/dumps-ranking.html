<h1>Bex's Favourite Dumpling spots</h1>
<h2>In New York City</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Wei's</h3>
<p>Next to my first NYC apartment, Wei's soup dumplings are to die for.</p>
<h3>King Dumplings</h3>
<p>Great cheap eats, and they have frozen dumplings so you can take them home for the week too!</p>
<h3>Last spot still up for grabs</h3>
<p>... waiting to go to Flushing to try out some of the classic favourites.</p>
