<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Here is my stream of consciousness on how I got here:</h2>

<p>I'm a Brit that is living in NYC and working for Reaktor doing Talent Acquisition. I completely fell into recruitment... 
  after doing a masters in Psychology, I wasn't very clued up on how to search for jobs, or what jobs were even out there!
</p>

<p>After a year stint in corporate communications in Brighton, UK, I returned to London without a job and was wondering what to do. 
  That is when I got a phone call from an old colleague of mine, who found my CV on a job board, asking me to come in for an interview. 
  I wasn't doing anything else, so I went. 
</p>

<p>I was offered the job, but honestly, I had no idea what recruitment was, or what I'd be doing, or really anything about what kinds of tasks I'd be doing. 
  I moved to another recruitment agency, then to NYC, then to another... after five years in agency recruitment, the pandemic took its toll and I lost my job.
  I did a couple of years out of recruitment, before returning to internal recruitment at Reaktor. 
</p>

<p>I've been working at Reaktor for almost two years now, and have been enjoying being internal for sure. 
  I recruit for all different roles: marketing, account management, design, engineering.
</p>

<p>Working with and recruiting so many engineers started to feel like living in France and not speaking any French.
  So, I thought to myself, why don't I learn to code in my spare time, and Emma, my 'Reaktor Buddy' pointed me in the direction of this online course.
</p>
   
<p>When I was picking my A-levels, my IT teacher begged me to do IT at A-Level but I said "no, it was full of boys"... 
  Now I find myself back here, years later refreshing myself on html and looking forward to the next modules. :) 
</p>

<p>That's all, thanks for reading.</p>
